#0:
\w+

#1
[\w]+(?=\.)
//This first part of the regex captures all words that end with aperiod

(?=[A-Z]+[\w])(([\w]+(?=\.)))
//This second part of the regex is an expansion upon that idea. This regex captures all of the words that end in a period and have a capital first letter. 

//with these two regexs I should be able to combine to get the final answer, but there is a logical leap that I am not understanding. 


#2

[\w]+\.+.*

//the .* is probably a little more of a catach all than needed....
